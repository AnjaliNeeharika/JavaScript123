operators:-
***********
- operators are spacial type of symbols used to perform some operations
on operands.

ex: -  2(operand1)*(symbol)3(operand2)

- unary 
- binary
- ternary

1. arithmatic operator:-
**************************
+ , - , * , / , % ,** , ++ , --
concatenation :- joinign of two or more string
typecasting:- changing one data type into another dattype.
NaN :- Not a number :- it is a specail type of number which is not leagl in javascript.
 

 increment :- 
        1.pre-increment :- it will increment the value by one before execution
        2.post-increment :- it will increment the value by one after executuion.

assignment operator:-
= , += , -= , /= , %= , *= 
let a =10;
clg(a+5)

relational operators:-
***********************
- relational operators always return boolean values.
== , === , != , !==(strictly not equals) , > , >= , < , <=

what is different between "==" & "===" ?(FAQ)
- "==" it will check only the values not the datatypes.
- "===" it will check both values and datatypes.


logical operators:-
*******************
 AND(&&) - it will return true only when both side conditions are true else return false
 OR(||) - it will return true when both side is true as well as anyone side is true else false.
 NOT(!) - it will make true as falsa and false as true.

 decision making statements:-
 ****************************
 if :- if block will execute only when the condition is true.
 - we can give only one condition for if 
 if-else :- if we ewant to display either of true / false we use if else block.
 - this also works with one condition.
 else if ladder
 switch
 ternery condition

 looping statements:-
 *********************
- looping statements are used to iterate the block of codes multiple times.
 1.for loop :- 
 -minimum iteration count of forloop is "0".
 syntax :-  for(initialization ; condition; updation)
                        {
                                //statemets
                        }
 2.while loop
 - minimum iteration count of while loop is "0".
 syntax :-  while(condition){
                        //statement
                        updation
                }
 3.do-while loop
 - minimum iteration count of d-while lool is "1".
 synatx :- do{
                //statements
                }while(condition)

- what are the entry controlled loop and exit controlled loop?
- for loop & while loops are entry controlled loops.
- do-while is a exit controlled loop.



functions:
**************

-- function is the block of code used to perform specific task assined to it.
-- function can be reuse for n number of times
-- functons is non primitive data type

                   (function name must be in lower case)
syntax-- function function_name(optional parameters)
          {
             //function body
            // statements
          }
          function_name(arguments);//function calling

function_name= demo
note:- withput calling function the function body never executed

Types of functons:-
1)Named function
-- function which is have in a name and invoked with the
2)anonymus function
--function which is doesnot have name to declare
3)function expresion
-- anonymus function declaratin is assigned as a value to variable and the same 
4)Imediate invoke function(IIFE)
-- once function created immediatly it will called
5)Arrow function::- ()=>{};
--it is used to consise to normal function syntaxsyntax
-- arrow function is similar to anonymus function
6)Hiher order function
7)Callback function
-- 


note:-
-- current version of javascript is es14
-- es6 is stable version of javascript
--es6

return statement:-
- it will return either expression or variables to future use.

implicit return :- returns without using a "return" keyword manually.

explicit return :- returns using "return" keyword manually


clouser:- it is a memory created when functions are bundled together and nested 
to each other by giving accessability inner most function to access the variables
 of outermost function.



JSON:- 

- JSON stands for javascript object notation.
-JSON is a javacript technique used to transfer the data from client to server

syntax:

let a={
        name:"value",
        age:25
        }

json object:
{
    "name": "sam",
    "age" : 25
}

json methods:-
1) JSON.stringify():-
2)Json.parse():-


Asynchronous in javascript:-
to perform multiple tasks at a time.

note:- js is by default "Synchronous(single threaded)".
mrtods in Asynchronous in javascript 
1)setTimeout() :-it is web api used to perform async operations with crtain time
2)setInterval()
3)promise
  a)pending state
  b)fulfilled state
  c)rejected state
syntax:-let x= new promise((resolve, reject)=>{});
To execute the promise we have the instance methods:-

   1)then():- it is used to execute scccess state or fulfilled state
   2)catch():-it is used to execute rejected state results
   3)finally():- once promise is settled it will print success or failure states


4)async & await


Create -POST
read - GET
update - PUT
Dlete - DELETE
